# Kubernetes CoreOS Vagrant

This repo provides a template Vagrantfile to create a Kubernetes CoreOS virtual machines using the VirtualBox software hypervisor.
After setup is complete you will have three CoreOS virtual machines running on your local machine.

## Streamlined setup

1) Install dependencies

* [VirtualBox][virtualbox] 4.3.10 or greater.
* [Vagrant][vagrant] 1.6 or greater.

2) Clone this project and get it running!

```
git clone https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant/
cd coreos-vagrant
```

3) Startup and SSH

There are two "providers" for Vagrant with slightly different instructions.
Follow one of the following two options:

**VirtualBox Provider**

The VirtualBox provider is the default Vagrant provider. Use this if you are unsure.

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

**VMware Provider**

The VMware provider is a commercial addon from Hashicorp that offers better stability and speed.
If you use this provider follow these instructions.

```
vagrant up --provider vmware_fusion
vagrant ssh
```

``vagrant up`` triggers vagrant to download the CoreOS image (if necessary) and (re)launch the instance

``vagrant ssh`` connects you to the virtual machine.
Configuration is stored in the directory so you can always return to this machine by executing vagrant ssh from the directory where the Vagrantfile was located.
